# Probability and Statistics in R

This project demonstrates the use of fundamental probability and statistics concepts in R, including basic probability, Bayes' theorem, expected value, and variance. The project contains four R scripts with random data generation and visualizations to aid understanding.

## File Descriptions

### 1. **`basic_probability.R`**
- **Purpose**: Calculate the probability of an event.
- **Problem**: Given a dataset of customer purchases, compute the probability of a customer buying a product.
- **Visualization**: Bar plot showing the frequency of customer purchase statuses.
- **Key Output**: 
  - Probability of `Buy` and `NoBuy`.

---

### 2. **`bayes_theorem.R`**
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate Bayes' theorem to compute conditional probability.
- **Problem**: Calculate the probability of having a disease given a positive test result.
- **Visualization**: Pie chart showing the probability of having or not having a disease given a positive test.
- **Key Output**:
  - \( P(\text{Disease} | \text{Test Positive}) \).

---

### 3. **`expected_value.R`**
- **Purpose**: Calculate the expected value (mean) of a random variable.
- **Problem**: Simulate rolling a die and calculate the expected prize.
- **Visualization**: Bar plot showing the probability distribution of die rolls.
- **Key Output**:
  - Expected value of the die rolls.

---

### 4. **`variance_calculation.R`**
- **Purpose**: Calculate the variance of a random variable.
- **Problem**: Analyze test scores' variance from a random dataset.
- **Visualization**: Histogram showing the distribution of test scores.
- **Key Output**:
  - Variance and expected value (mean) of the test scores.

## How to Run the Code
1. Install R and RStudio on your machine.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open each `.R` file in RStudio.
4. Run the scripts using the "Run" button or execute them line by line to see the outputs.
5. Visualizations will appear in the Plots pane of RStudio.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- R (v4.0 or higher)
- RStudio
- No additional R packages are required as the scripts use base R functions.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of basic probability, Bayes' theorem, expected value, and variance in statistical analysis and machine learning.
- Practice implementing statistical concepts using R.
- Visualize data and statistical results with bar plots, histograms, and pie charts.
